## Description

In this work, we presents a novel method that enhances data privacy and interoperability in biomedical research by using advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate private, high-quality synthetic notes.

- Facilitates global collaboration with anonymized synthetic notes while maintaining patient data usability.
- Enhances trust, transparency, and security in patient data usage, encouraging participation in clinical research.
- Sets new ethical standards for AI in healthcare, representing a paradigm shift in patient privacy protection.
